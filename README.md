Bloodstained Randomizer Enhancement

Collection of C# scripts that will change the way the Bloodstained Randomizer behaves.

Works on current version as of Dec 22, 2020.


Notes and changes.

Morte no longer has a shard.
All other enemies have a unique shard drop.
Candles/Globes are not randomized.
Glutton Train always has HammerKnuckle.
Craftwork leads to a softlock.
Shop is randomized and includes some new items.
Crafter is randomized.  No longer shuffled.
There is some base logic to ensure early progression.


To play, start a randomizer seed.
Ensure that enemy shards are not shuffled.
Ensure that the shop and crafter are not shuffled.
